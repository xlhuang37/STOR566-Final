# STOR566-Final

This is the final project of Group 10 in the class STOR566. The BiDAF folder contains our modified version of BiDAF. However, the code won't work without downloading and processing SQuAD dataset. The BERT folder contains our jupyter notebook for BERT experiments. Running the code requires the installation of  hugging face "transformers", "datasets", and "Evaluation" libraries.
